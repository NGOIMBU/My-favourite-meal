    <p>My special meal is jollof rice</p>
    <br>
    <p>Jollof rice, is a rice dish from West Africa. The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables and
       meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions.The origins of jollof rice can 
       be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Wolof or JolofEmpire in the 14th century, spanning parts of today's Senegal,
       The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice was grown. The dish has its roots in atraditional dish called thieboudienne, containing rice,
       fish, shellfish and vegetables.</p>
